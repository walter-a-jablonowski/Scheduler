# Scheduler

All in one scheduler: configure a single task in your system's scheduler instead of many (less config work)

- just run a single script that uses this class
- configure multiple tasks in yml (syncable on multiple devices)
- also supports advanced features like running a task based on likeliness

```bash
> cd debug
> composer install

> composer require symfony/yaml
```

## Sample

```php
$config    = Yaml::parseFile('config.yml');
$scheduler = new Scheduler( $config['scheduler'], 'cache.json', [
  'user'    => '/home/username',  // placeholders for field file: {user}/file.txt
  'scripts' => '/var/scripts'
]);

try  {
  $scheduler->run();
}
catch( Exception $e ) {
  error_log("Scheduler error: " . $e->getMessage());  // or use your own logging
  exit();
}
```

**Config**

```yaml
scheduler:

  - type:       URL
    name:       quick_sync
    url:        http://example.com/quick-sync
    args:       
      action:   sync
      mode:     quick
    interval:   5min                      # 5min, 10min, 30min, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly (5sec, 10sec used for debugging)
    likeliness: 75                        # 75% chance of running when due

  - type:       URL
    name:       daily_backup
    url:        http://example.com/daily-backup
    interval:   daily

  - type:       Script

    interval:   daily
```
